* What is Heroku 

A place to run & scale your apps on the Internet

* Why would I be interested in it
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
- You cant run your apps from your laptop
- You probably dont have funding to hire an operations team
- You do want to focus on building something your customers love

* So how can Heroku help 

Heroku works in the way developers want
- providing resources on demand to support your development needs
- using tools developers are familiar with (Git)

* Time for a very simple demo
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag roll-in
1) I built an app on my laptop
2) Put the code in version control
3) Create a space for the app on Heroku
4) Deployed the app
5) Made some changes to the code
6) Deployed a new version of the app

* Continuous Deployment

Heroku helps you change you app as your business needs it
- IT is not the bottleneck

* Consistent Environments

Your bugs are all your own, not from the environment

* Supports virtually every language

Ruby, NodeJS, Java, Python are main supported language
- over 50 other languages have been deployed to Heroku

* Easy & Fast to Scale

If you can use your mouse, you can scale your apps (up & down)
- scaling happens almost instantly

Quickly handle a big spike in customer traffic
- avoid loosing customers because of success
