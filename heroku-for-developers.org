* Lets start with a demo
- Heroku Button - [[https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample][Node.js heroku sample app]]
- Heroku Button - [[https://github.com/jr0cket/budget-app-clj][Clojure Budget app with Luminus]]
- Heroku Button - [[https://github.com/heroku/ruby-rails-sample][Ruby Rails app]]
- [[https://github.com/heroku/ruby-getting-started][Ruby app and Postgres Database]]
- Node.js simple site (command line)

* Overview of Heroku 
** Platform as a Service (PaaS)
[[file:./images/heroku-overview-concept.png][file:./images/heroku-overview-concept.png]]

Highly scalable deployment platform
- developers can focus on their apps
- [[https://addons.heroku.com][add-on services]] to help build your apps
- [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps][DevOps]] team as a service

** Developer focused
Use Git to securely transfer code to Heroku

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
git push heroku master
#+END_SRC

[[http://jr0cket.co.uk/developer-guides/heroku-deployment-process-simplified.png][Heroku deployment process (simplified)]]

** Flexible Language support 

[[./images/heroku-languages-supported.png]]

Ruby, Node.js, Python & Java 
- [[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/third-party-buildpacks][community]] buildpacks for everything else
- fork / create your own buildpacks
** Scalable platform
Scale your apps "instantly"

** Continuous Deployment

* Getting Started
** Create a free account

[[https://www.heroku.com][www.heroku.com]]

** Install Heroku Toolbelt

toolbelt.heroku.com

Securely identify yourself with Heroku

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
heroku login
#+END_SRC


* Developing your first app on Heroku
** Start developing your app
- using what ever language you like
 
** Version your app with Git

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
git init 
git add .
git commit -m "meaningful message"
#+END_SRC

[[file:./images/git-local-workflow.png][file:./images/git-local-workflow.png]]

** Create an app on Heroku
Connects your local Git repository to Heroku
Creates a unique URL for your app

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
heroku create
heroku create unique-name
heroku create --region eu|us 
#+END_SRC

[[file:./images/heroku-developer-workflow--create.png][file:./images/heroku-developer-workflow--create.png]]

** Deploy your app
Push your committed code to Heroku securely

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
git push heroku master
#+END_SRC

[[file:./images/heroku-developer-workflow--push.png][file:./images/heroku-developer-workflow--push.png]]

[[http://jr0cket.co.uk/developer-guides/heroku-deployment-process-simplified.png][Heroku deployment process (simplified)]]

** Continuous Deployment

[[file:./images/heroku-continuous-delivery.png][file:./images/heroku-continuous-delivery.png]]

** Tracable Deployment
Git version numbers used to label each Heroku deployment
- trace which version is deployed using Git log

[[file:./images/git-log-commit-graph-decorate-oneline-abbrev-commit.png][file:./images/git-log-commit-graph-decorate-oneline-abbrev-commit.png]]
** Dashboard Activity trail
Audit trail of activity for your app deployment

** Heroku Dashboard in detail 

[[file:./images/heroku-dashboard-overview-example.png][file:./images/heroku-dashboard-overview-example.png]]

** Collaborating with Heroku

* Running and Scaling your app 

[[file:./images/heroku-scalability-concept.png][file:./images/heroku-scalability-concept.png]]

** Defining Processes
[[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile][Procfile]] defines all the different processes in your app 

[[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model][Heroku Process Model]]

** Web & other process types
web: listens on http/https

worker: one off process jobs

call processes other than web anything you like

** Scaling a process

[[file:./images/heroku-scalability-concept.png][file:./images/heroku-scalability-concept.png]]

Scale a process up or down, instantly

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
heroku ps:scale web=4
heroku ps:scale worker=2 
#+END_SRC

** Example Node app with multiple process 

[[file:./images/heroku-dashboard-scaling-processes-node-example.png][file:./images/heroku-dashboard-scaling-processes-node-example.png]]

** Auto Scaling
Services available in the [[https://addons.heroku.com][Heroku addons]] marketplace
- analyse the performance of your code first though

** Guiding Principles
[[http://12factor.net][12factor.net]]

* Managing Apps
** Consistent Environments
Dev, Test, QA, Staging, Production all from same codebase
- automated creation of environments
- automated deployment
- minimises errors
- repeatable process

** Environment Variables 
Manage differences in environments easily
Avoid hard coding configuration 

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh 
heroku config
#+END_SRC

** Heroku Logs
[[https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging][Heroku logplex]]: all your logs in one stream 

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh 
heroku logs --tail
heroku logs --source app | ps | heroku
#+END_SRC

** Longer term Logging
[[https://addons.heroku.com][Heroku Addons]]
- Logly
- Papertrail

** Releases
Every Git Push is a Release
Every Environment Variable change is a Release
Every Addon service is a Release

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh 
heroku releases
heroku releases:info v42
#+END_SRC

** Rollbacks 
Instantly roll back to a previous version

#+BEGIN_SRC zsh 
heroku releases:rollback
heroku releases:rollback v42
#+END_SRC

** Accessing the server, safely
Spin up a copy of your app and access via secure shell

#+BEGIN_SRC bash 
heroku run bash 
heroku run bundle ...
#+END_SRC
